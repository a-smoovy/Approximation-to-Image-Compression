# Approximation-to-Image-Compression

The phenomenon of image compression has emerged as a focal point of data analysis and machine learning given the progression of technology the 21st century has witnessed. As a result, there are several existing forms of data compression that have entered this space -- namely, JPEG, PNG, and, more recently, GIFs -- and have taken the image compression space by storm. With this in mind, the objective of this study is to apply the method of singular value decomposition (SVD) and analyze its image compression performance for different parameter values. The evaluation of SVD's image reconstruction performance is carried out in a multitude of ways including monitoring runtime, analyzing image resolution and clarity, and comparing the results to those of other established compression methods. Specifically, fast fourier transformation (FFT) and wavelet transform compression are implemented for analytical and examanatory purposes - how will SVD's image reconstruction compare to that of orthodox compression methods?

Now that the general objective of this study has been outlined, it is necessary that the SVD method is contextualized.
